                        <p>Trong is a Ho Chi Minh-Based UX Designer, currently building the e-commerce site call Leflair, an online retailer that focuses on beauty, fashion and home living products.</p>
                        <p>He spent 5 years in a tech university to learn IT, but he soon realized design is his passion. He hated coding, but his gut told him to finish the engineering diploma while learning to design in his free time. And when he met the UX term, basic knowledge in IT became an important foundation in his career.</p>
                        <p>One of the greatest things about being a designer with an engineering background is that not only he can take care of the graphical aspects of a project, but can also fully understand, participate and even take care of the technical aspects of those projects.</p>
